// raceexample wraps sync.Map in a type-safe way, but sadly the implementation has a
// a possible data race in handling a counter on the objects stored in the sync.Map.
//
// To observe the data race with the race detector:
//     1. A Store must be followed by two Loads, and all three must use the same key.
//     2. The Store must have certain payload data (Answer: 42).
//     3. The two Loads must happen concurrently.
//     4. Prior to the two Loads, no other Store can update the key to have a non-matching payload.
//
// Using the fzgen/fuzzer.Chain created by default via 'fzgen -chain -parallel github.com/thepudds/fzgen/examples/inputs/race',
// this data race is typically caught after a few minutes of fuzzing with '-race' when starting from scratch.
